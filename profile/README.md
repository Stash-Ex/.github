**Stash-Ex** is the organization that owns and maintains a growing family of applications and software development kits (coming soon ðŸ¤ž) for interacting with the metaverse on any internet connected platform, united by the Starknet Blockchain.

The current applications under development are:

- [Stash Protocol](https://github.com/Stash-Ex/stash-protocol) - a collection of Starknet smart contracts written in cairo that allows users to securely lock digital assets and tie them to any location in the metaverse (arbitrary string like URL, GPS coordinates, etc). Any user with knowledge of the location and correct set of keys may unlock the stash and claim its contents.
- [Stash Extension](https://github.com/Stash-Ex/stash-extension) - a browser extension that enables new interactions and engagement with the web. Built on the Stash Protocol, this web extension allows one to stash digital assets on any website as well as discover and claim stashes left by others, in an entirely permissionless manner.

Please have a look at the Github repositories for more information. Both the Stash protocol and extension have roadmaps full of features and enhancements supporting new use-cases. There are additional things that need to be built such as backends, dedicated UI, SDKs for game development (AR/VR), and premium features to support a diverse set of users such as content creators and brands. We are looking for anyone that is interested in the project and would like to contribute.

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. Please start a discussion on the relevant project's discussion board, raise an issue, or post a PR and it will be looked at with and utmost urgency.
